#  Multi-Tape Universal Turing Machine (UTM) Visualizer

A lightweight, browser-based **multi-tape Turing Machine visualizer** built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — no external libraries or dependencies required.

This interactive tool lets you **load, run, and visualize** Turing Machine encodings (either in readable or Base64 binary format), step through transitions, set breakpoints, and inspect execution logs.

---

##  Features

- **Supports multiple tapes** — visualize side-by-side or in a concatenated view  
- **Load Encodings** from text or Base64 binary  
- **Step-by-step execution** or continuous auto-run with adjustable delay  
- **Save and load presets** using `local Storage`  
- **Set breakpoints** by clicking any tape cell  
- **View live debug logs** of every transition  
-**Educational interface** for understanding Turing Machine computation visually  


##  Run the Project

To run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/multi-tape-utm-visualizer.git
